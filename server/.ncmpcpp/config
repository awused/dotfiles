##### song format #####
##
## For a song format you can use:
##
## %l - length
## %f - filename
## %D - directory
## %a - artist
## %A - album artist
## %t - title
## %b - album
## %y - date
## %n - track number (01/12 -> 01)
## %N - full track info (01/12 -> 01/12)
## %g - genre
## %c - composer
## %p - performer
## %d - disc
## %C - comment
## %P - priority
## $R - begin right alignment
##
## If you want to make sure that a part of the format is displayed only when
## certain tags are present, you can archieve it by grouping them with brackets,
## e.g. '{%a - %t}' will be evaluated to 'ARTIST - TITLE' if both tags are
## present or '' otherwise.  It is also possible to define a list of
## alternatives by providing several groups and separating them with '|',
## e.g. '{%t}|{%f}' will be evaluated to 'TITLE' or 'FILENAME' if the former is
## not present.
##
## Note: If you want to set limit on maximal length of a tag, just put the
## appropriate number between % and character that defines tag type, e.g. to
## make album take max. 20 terminal cells, use '%20b'.
##
## In addition, formats support markers used for text attributes.  They are
## followed by character '$'. After that you can put:
##
## - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
## - 1 - black
## - 2 - red
## - 3 - green
## - 4 - yellow
## - 5 - blue
## - 6 - magenta
## - 7 - cyan
## - 8 - white
## - 9 - end of current color
## - b - bold text
## - u - underline text
## - r - reverse colors
## - a - use alternative character set
##
## If you don't want to use a non-color attribute anymore, just put it again,
## but this time insert character '/' between '$' and attribute character,
## e.g. {$b%t$/b}|{$r%f$/r} will display bolded title tag or filename with
## reversed colors.
##
## If you want to use 256 colors and/or background colors in formats (the naming
## scheme is described below in section about color definitions), it can be done
## with the syntax $(COLOR), e.g. to set the artist tag to one of the
## non-standard colors and make it have yellow background, you need to write
## $(197_yellow)%a$(end). Note that for standard colors this is interchangable
## with attributes listed above.
##
## Note: colors can be nested.

##### columns settings #####
##
## syntax of song columns list format is "column column etc."
##
## - syntax for each column is:
##
## (width of the column)[color of the column]{displayed tag}
##
## Note: Width is by default in %, if you want a column to have fixed size, add
## 'f' after the value, e.g. (10)[white]{a} will be the column that take 10% of
## screen (so the real width will depend on actual screen size), whereas
## (10f)[white]{a} will take 10 terminal cells, no matter how wide the screen
## is.
##
## - color is optional (if you want the default one, leave the field empty).
##
## Note: You can give a column additional attributes by putting appropriate
## character after displayed tag character. Available attributes are:
##
## - r - column will be right aligned
## - E - if tag is empty, empty tag marker won't be displayed
##
## You can also:
##
## - give a column custom name by putting it after attributes, separated with
##   character ':', e.g. {lr:Length} gives you right aligned column of lengths
##   named "Length".
##
## - define sequence of tags, that have to be displayed in case predecessor is
##   empty in a way similar to the one in classic song format, i.e. using '|'
##   character, e.g. {a|c|p:Owner} creates column named "Owner" that tries to
##   display artist tag and then composer and performer if previous ones are not
##   available.
